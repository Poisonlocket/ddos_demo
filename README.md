# ddos_demo
90% of the Code has been authored by chatgpt, im just using this for a school demo and too lazy to spin up a bare webserver on the go (wait do i hear go?, yeah i should have implemented his in go, better performance and cooler code) lmao, use at your own risk

## This repo includes:
- a weak server (server.py)
- a ddos script (ddos.py) **please use responsibly, im not liable for whatever shenanigans and crimes you do with this**
- a very secure webserver (secure_server.py)
- a visualisation script that also ddoses the servers and puts out a graph about the sucessful requests (monitoring.py)

The visualisation script requires the server to be run and doesnt run it itself, target address can be specified though ^^
